			<p>tap a tempo anywhere within the blank area (or tap the spacebar) to see the bpm reading</p>
			<p>the more taps are counted, the more accurate the reading will be - you should find it takes around 5-10 beats to see an accurate reading</p>
			<p>the time-signature is set to 4/4 (common) by default - this can be changed by using the drop-down in the top-right corner</p>
